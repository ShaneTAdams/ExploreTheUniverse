//This Website is about outer space.

//The Log-In Page will route you no where.  In a fully functioning website I would like that information sent to a database to be stored and then the user routed to the main page.

//Not a whole lot to this, each html page has it's own dedicated CSS file.  I have normalize.css attached to all the index pages.


//The UniverseHome just has some fun facts.  There is a javascript file that is running on the page.  Just a little slideshow you can click through to check out some little pictures.  

//The links up top should allow you to jump around to the different pages.  Enjoy!
